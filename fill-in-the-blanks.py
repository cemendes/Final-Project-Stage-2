# IPND Stage 2 Final Project

# You've built a Mad-Libs game with some help from Sean.
# Now you'll work on your own game to practice your skills and demonstrate what you've learned.

# For this project, you'll be building a Fill-in-the-Blanks quiz.
# Your quiz will prompt a user with a paragraph containing several blanks.
# The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the paragraph.
# This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!

# Note: Your game will have to accept user input so, like the Mad Libs generator,
# you won't be able to run it using Sublime's `Build` feature.
# Instead you'll need to run the program in Terminal or IDLE.
# Refer to Work Session 5 if you need a refresher on how to do this.

# To help you get started, we've provided a sample paragraph that you can use when testing your code.
# Your game should consist of 3 or more levels, so you should add your own paragraphs as well!

# The answer for ___1___ is 'function'. Can you figure out the others?

# We've also given you a file called fill-in-the-blanks.pyc which is a working version of the project.
# A .pyc file is a Python file that has been translated into "byte code".
# This means the code will run the same as the original .py file, but when you open it
# it won't look like Python code! But you can run it just like a regular Python file
# to see how your code should behave.


# Hint: It might help to think about how this project relates to the Mad Libs generator you built with Sean.
# In the Mad Libs generator, you take a paragraph and replace all instances of NOUN and VERB.
# How can you adapt that design to work with numbered blanks?

example of how to output to the user using the ___3___ command, and produces a program which does something, so it is useful
in that capacity.'It may seem a bit odd to do something in a Turing complete language that can be done even more easily
with an ___4___ file in a browser, but it's a step in learning ___2___ syntax, and that's really its purpose.'''

and ___2___. It is a mixture of the ___1___ mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python ___1___es provide all the standard
features of Object Oriented Programming: the ___1___ inheritance mechanism allows multiple base ___1___es, a derived ___1___ can
override any ___3___ of its base ___1___ or ___1___es, and a method can call the __3__ of a base ___2___ with the same name.
Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, ___1___es partake of the dynamic nature
of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.'''
